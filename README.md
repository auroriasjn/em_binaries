# EM Binaries Project
Description here TBD.

# Installation
Please ```git clone``` this repository by running the following command:
```angular2html
git clone https://github.com/auroriasjn/em_binaries.git
```
Upon installation, please **change directories** into the `em_binaries` directory:
```angular2html
cd em_binaries
```
Make sure that you have **Anaconda** installed. Run the following command
```angular2html
./install.sh
```
This will create
an entirely new Anaconda environment for you called ```iso_env```.

**Do note that this project only works for arm64 architectures due to how isochrones is compiled under the hood. The installation fails on x86_64 architectures.**
